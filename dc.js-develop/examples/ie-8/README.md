# Galarie CSS and old Internet Explorers

Galarie CSS can be run in IE8, this example is designed to serve as a few hints for how you can achieve that goal. 

Auto-playing / animation is not possible, in IE8 using Galarie CSS, so if that's the one thing you require from your gallery, then sadly you'd have to get back to JS gallerys.
